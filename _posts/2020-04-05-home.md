To date, coronavirus testing in the US has been extremely limited. Confirmed COVID-10 case counts underestimate the total number of infections in the population. We estimated the total burden of COVID-19 infections -- both symptomatic and asymptomatic -- in the US in March 2020. We used a semi-Bayesian approach to correct for bias due to incomplete testing and imperfect test performance. See additional details on methods [**below**](#methods) and a full description of our methods here.

### Current confirmed COVID-19 case counts vastly underestimate total infection burden.

Correcting for under-testing and imperfect test performance, We estimated that the total COVID-19 infections by this date was 4,863,576 (15 per 1,000) By March 31, 2020. This number vastly exceeds the 184,343 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported during that period (0.6 per 1,000). 

The estimated total COVID-19 infections <span style="color:orange">(shown in orange)</span> -- including symptomatic and asymptomatic infections -- vastly exceeds confirmed case counts <span style="color:purple; font-weight:bold;">(shown in purple)</span>. In March, the number of expected infections in the U.S. was 26 times larger than the number of observed cases. We estimated that 56% of infections had moderate or severe symptoms and 44% had mild or no symptoms.

### Disparities between confirmed case counts and estimated infections varied by state.

The ratio of expected infections to observed cases can be interpreted as the multiplication factor for a given state. For example, in Florida, the number of expected infections is 50 times the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. The states with the highest discrepancy between estimated infections and confirmed case counts tended to have lower testing rates per capita.

### Geographic disparities in testing contribute to larger underestimates in certain regions. 

States in the midwestern and Appalachian region tended to have a larger discrepancy between observed cases and expected infections.

### The top ten states with highest estimated COVID-infections differ from the top ten based on confirmed cases. 

The top ten states with the largest estimated infections per 1,000 include Hawaii, New Mexico, Utah, and North Dakota, which are not ranked in the top ten largest confirmed COVID-19 case counts per 1,000.

### State-level trajectories over time differ when correcting for under testing
The top three states with the greatest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 1,000 were New York, New Jersey, and Louisiana. However, when examining trajectories of estimated total infections -- including asymptomatic infection -- the top three states by the end of March were New York, Washington, and Louisiana. In part, the discrepancy in trajectories reflects differing levels of testing in each state.

### Methods
We used a probabilistic bias analysis to correct confirmed COVID-19 case counts for under testing, systematic testing of individuals with moderate-to-severe infection, and imperfect test performance. We used the best available evidence to define distributions of the probability of being symptomatic if tested for COVID-19, being symptomatic if not tested, and testing positive among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Using Bayesian melding, we constrained these probabilities by an assumed distribution of the probability that individuals who tested positive were asymptomatic using evidence from populations with more widespread testing. We also corrected for the possilibity of false negative test results (imperfect test sensitivity). Each distribution builds in uncertainty about each probability. See a full description of our methods here. Analyses include cumulative case counts from March 7 to 31, 2020. Disaggregated state-level data prior to March 7, 2020 was not readily available. We will update this site with estimates for April 2020 as additional data becomes available.
