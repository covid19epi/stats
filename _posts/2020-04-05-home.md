_To date, coronavirus testing in the US has been extremely limited. Confirmed COVID-10 case counts underestimate the total number of infections in the population. We estimated the total burden of COVID-19 infections -- both symptomatic and asymptomatic -- in the US in March 2020 using a semi-Bayesian statistical approach. See a full description of our methods here._

Note: Analyses include cumulative case counts from March 7 to 31, 2020. Disaggregated state-level data prior to March 7, 2020 was not readily available. 

### Under-estimation of COVID-19 case counts due to incomplete testing and imperfect test performance in March 2020 in the United States

Panel A) shows the absolute number of observed cases (purple) and expected infections (orange). States are sorted by the ratio of expected infections to observed cases, as shown in Panel B. 

Panel B) shows the ratio of expected infections to observed cases can be interpreted as the multiplication factor for a given state. For example, a ratio of 50 means that the number of expected infections is 50 times the number of observed cases.
