To date, coronavirus testing in the US has been extremely limited. Confirmed COVID-10 case counts underestimate the total number of infections in the population. We estimated the total COVID-19 infections -- both symptomatic and asymptomatic -- in the US in March 2020. We used a semi-Bayesian approach to correct for bias due to incomplete testing and imperfect test performance. We estimated that the number of COVID-19 infections in the U.S. was 26 times larger than the number of confirmed cases, with substantial variability by state.

### Infections per State

> Current confirmed COVID-19 case counts vastly underestimate total infection burden.

Correcting for under-testing and imperfect test performance, we estimated that the total number of COVID-19 infections was 4,863,576 (15 per 1,000) by March 31, 2020. This number vastly exceeds the 184,343 confirmed COVID-19 cases reported during that period (0.6 per 1,000). 

Below, estimated total COVID-19 infections -- including symptomatic and asymptomatic infections -- are shown in <span style="color:orange">(orange)</span>, and confirmed COVID-19 case counts are shown in <span style="color:purple; font-weight:bold;">(purple)</span>. In March, the number of expected infections in the U.S. was 26 times larger than the number of confirmed cases. We estimated that 56% of infections had moderate or severe symptoms and 44% had mild or no symptoms.

		Analyses include cumulative confirmed COVID-19 case counts up to March 31, 2020. Expected infections were estimated using Bayesian probabilistic bias analysis to correct for incomplete testing and imperfect test performance. Expected infections include both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections. Observed case counts (purple) overlap with expected infections (orange) such that the size of each orange bar is equal to the total number of expected infections.

> Disparities between confirmed case counts and estimated infections varied by state.

The ratio of expected infections to confirmed COVID-19 cases can be interpreted as the multiplication factor for a given state. For example, in Florida, the number of expected infections is 50 times the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. The states with the highest discrepancy -- shown at the top of the graph -- between estimated infections and confirmed case counts tended to have lower testing rates per capita.

### Infection Map

> Geographic disparities in testing contribute to larger underestimates in certain regions. 

States in the midwestern and Appalachian regions tended to have a larger discrepancy between confirmed COVID-19 cases and expected total infections.

### Top Ten Infected States

> The top ten states with highest estimated COVID-19 infections differ from the top ten based on confirmed cases. 

The top ten states with the largest estimated infections per 1,000 included several states well below the top ten states ranked by confirmed COVID-19 cases. For example, Hawaii has the 6th highest number of estimated infections but ranks 42nd in confirmed cases.

The “Confirmed cases” column shows the rank of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 1,000 by state, and the “Estimated infections” column shows the rank of estimated infections per 1,000 by state. States with higher estimated infections per 1,000 compared to confirmed cases per 1,000 are connected with purple lines. Darker lines indicate larger increases in rank between confirmed cases and estimated infections.

### Infections by Date

> State-level trajectories over time differ when correcting for under testing

The top three states with the greatest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases per 1,000 were New York, New Jersey, and Louisiana. However, when examining trajectories of estimated total infections -- including asymptomatic infection -- the top three states were New York, Washington, and Louisiana. In part, the discrepancy in trajectories reflects differing levels of testing in each state.

### Methods
We used a probabilistic bias analysis to correct confirmed COVID-19 case counts for under testing, systematic testing of individuals with moderate-to-severe infection, and imperfect test performance. We used the best available evidence to define prior distributions of the probability of being symptomatic if tested for COVID-19, being symptomatic if not tested, and testing positive among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. Using Bayesian melding, we constrained these probabilities by an assumed distribution of the probability that individuals who tested positive were asymptomatic using evidence from populations with more widespread testing. We also corrected for the possilibity of false negative test results (imperfect test sensitivity). Prior distributions build in uncertainty given the limited information about COVID-19 testing among symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals to date. Analyses include cumulative confirmed COVID-19 case counts up to March 31, 2020. Disaggregated state-level data prior to March 7, 2020 was not readily available. We will update this site with estimates for April 2020 as additional data becomes available. See a full description of our methods here.
